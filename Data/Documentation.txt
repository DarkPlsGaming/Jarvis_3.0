This file documents the working of J3.

Upon initialization, J3 starts listening for the key (right control). The key is the button which starts the user
speech input when it's pressed. Then, the speech input is taken, converted to text and then is checked for commands.
If there is no command in the string, it is ignored, otherwise the command is executed.
