Laws of Farhan state that:
1) Can memorise entire book in one reading, phtographic memory students take tution from him. (In a special case scenario, where this law clashes with one of The Laws Of Hila Sir, Hilal Sir's law has the chance of 200% in getting dominant.)
2) Spend 50% of your school time in school washroom. (Inclusive to Hibernation)
3) Have a rate of 80% of sleeping in the washroom and going missing for two days straight.
4) Atleast eating one type of food in class every two days. (chewing gum, biscuits, etc)
5) Can run at twice the speed of light. Fastest object in the universe, especially when chasing someone. (especially his best friend Absar)
6) Be addicted to books, NEVER return them to anyone even if you only "borrow" them for 1 day.
7) Says "I am studying" to parents but watching Chota Bheem the entire night.
8) Similar the Sheeran's law but still under development, memorised the entire history of all the animes/shows/books that exist. (except Game Of Thrones)
